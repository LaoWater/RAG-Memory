    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ default_vector_store.json
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Purpose: Stores vector embeddings (numerical representations) of text chunks (nodes).
    â”‚       Contains: Embeddings, mapping from embedding ID to node ID.
    â”‚       Context: Used for semantic similarity searches. Core of vector indexes.

    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ docstore.json
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Purpose: Stores the actual text content and metadata of the original documents/nodes.
    â”‚       Contains: Mapping from node ID to Node object (text, metadata).
    â”‚       Context: Used to retrieve the source text/context corresponding to relevant node IDs found via vector search or other index lookups.
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ graph_store.json
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Purpose: Stores relationships and structure for graph-based indexes (like Knowledge Graphs).
    â”‚       Contains: Nodes and edges representing entities and their connections.
    â”‚       Context: Used for graph traversal queries, finding related entities. Often EMPTY if only vector/keyword indexes are used.

    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ image_vector_store.json
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Purpose: Stores vector embeddings specifically for images (in multimodal scenarios).
    â”‚       Contains: Image embeddings, mapping to image node IDs.
    â”‚       Context: Used for image similarity search or cross-modal queries. EMPTY if only text data is indexed.
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ index_store.json
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Purpose: Stores metadata about the index structure(s) themselves. Acts as the "entry point" map.
    â”‚       Contains: Information about different index types present (vector, keyword, graph) and their corresponding IDs/references within other stores.
    â”‚       Context: Used by LlamaIndex to understand how the various components (docstore, vector stores, etc.) fit together to reconstruct the complete index(es).
