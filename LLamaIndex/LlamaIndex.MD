LlamaIndex - What is happening at Low-level? Beyond Libraries.

## How is the token window built before feeding it to the LLM?

Let’s walk through a typical run of the script:

1. **Library Setup**  
   - We set up the library with the desired LLM, properly wrapped as per documentation.

2. **Document Retrieval**  
   - The source document is retrieved.

3. **Indexing**  
   - The document is indexed in vector multi-dimensional space.  
   - Purpose: improve access speed, performance, and contextual understanding (attention mechanisms).

4. **Prompt Generation**  
   - A user or system generates a prompt.

5. **Query Execution**  
   - The prompt and index are combined in a `query_engine` and execution begins.

### What happens under the hood?

- We no longer have direct low-level control.
- Likely steps within the query engine:
  1. **Prompt Embedding**  
     - The prompt is embedded using similar vector/embedding laws.

  2. **Contextual Retrieval**  
     - The system compares prompt embeddings with the indexed document.
     - Relevant data is retrieved — we can call this **NDTA (Needed Data To Answer)**.

  3. **Preparation for LLM**  
     - NDTA is translated or passed as plain English (as a bridge between embedding logic and language model).
     - The final **token window** is constructed as:  
       `Retrieved Data + Prompt`

6. **Final Step: Inference**  
   - The token window is fed to the LLM.
   - The model infers the final answer.






----- From Intuition to Definitions & Theory back-up

Raul, that’s a **beautiful mental model**, and you’re 100% on the right track. Let me break it down in layers, while sprinkling in **what happens under the hood** of LlamaIndex, particularly in this LLM-agnostic setup (like with Gemini).

### 🧬 HIGH-LEVEL FLOW (Like you said):

1. **Initialize LLM + ServiceContext**
2. **Load + chunk documents** into Nodes
3. **Index the Nodes (e.g., into a vector index)**
4. **User gives a prompt**
5. **Retrieve relevant Nodes (NDTA as you called it)**
6. **Build final prompt = [Retrieved Chunks] + [User Prompt]**
7. **Send to LLM (Gemini here) for answer**

---

### 🧠 LOW-LEVEL BREAKDOWN — What's really happening:

#### 1. **Document Loading & Splitting**

When you call:
    documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(...).load_data()

This loads plain text files. Internally, LlamaIndex wraps them into `Document` objects.

These are then **split** into **Nodes** via default (or custom) chunking logic — usually ~512 to ~1024 tokens per chunk.

    Document → Node 1
             → Node 2
             → Node 3
             ...

You can customize the splitter to be sentence-aware, paragraph-aware, etc.

---

#### 2. **Indexing (VectorStoreIndex)**

    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

Behind the scenes:

- Each **Node** is embedded into a vector using a configured **embedding model** (OpenAI, Gemini embeddings, HuggingFace, etc.)
- These vectors + metadata (like text, node ID) are stored in a vector store (default is `FAISS`, but can be others: Qdrant, Pinecone, etc.)

This creates the **retrieval base** for later steps.

---

#### 3. **Querying**

    response = query_engine.query("What are the concerns related to AI?")

Here's the low-level magic behind this:

##### a) **Prompt → Embedding**

The query is converted to a vector via the **same embedding model** used to index nodes.

##### b) **Retrieve Top-K Nodes**

It runs a vector similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity) to retrieve the top K relevant Nodes.

Let’s call these **NDTA = Needed Data To Answer**.

##### c) **Build LLM Prompt**

It now **concatenates** those retrieved nodes and your original query into a final prompt.

Something like:

    CONTEXT:
    [Node 1 content]
    [Node 2 content]
    [Node 3 content]

    QUESTION:
    What are the concerns related to AI?

This is the string that goes to `llm.complete(prompt)` — so yes, your intuition was 🔥:  

> “The token window is built as: Retrieved Data + Prompt”

LlamaIndex tries to **optimize token use** by:
- Deduplicating
- Trimming
- Using compression (optional)
- Doing chunk merging intelligently to fit into the window

---

#### 4. **LLM Inference**

The final prompt is sent to your wrapped LLM (Gemini in this case), and its `.generate_content()` method produces a natural language answer.

---

### ⚠️ Can you access or control this more deeply?

Yes — LlamaIndex exposes a lot of internals like:

- `query_engine.retrieve()` → lets you inspect the raw NDTA nodes
- `query_engine.get_prompts()` → see final prompt constructed
- You can override the prompt builders, retrievers, chunkers, compressors, and more.

Example:

    nodes = query_engine.retrieve("Explain privacy risks in AI.")
    for n in nodes:
        print(n.text)  # See what it retrieved

    prompt = query_engine.get_prompts("Explain privacy risks in AI.")
    print(prompt)  # See the exact LLM input

### 🧠 TL;DR - Mental Model Recap

You basically nailed it:

    Raw Docs 
    → Chunked → Embedded → Indexed
    → Query → Embedded → Similarity Search
    → Retrieved NDTA → Final Prompt (NDTA + Query)
    → LLM (Token Window built)
    → Final Response
